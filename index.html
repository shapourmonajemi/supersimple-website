    <h2>CLASSES</h2>
    <p>As wonderful as our shows are, the main goals of this theatre company are fulfilled each week  in the "classroom" settings of our semester-long courses and week-long summer camps. With carefully selected teaching teams of dedicated, experienced instructors, directors,  and choreographers, your child is in good hands. We believe in results measured by a child's confidence, enthusiasm, and desire to further improve their performance skills through practice inside and outside of weekly classes.
